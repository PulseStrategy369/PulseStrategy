### PulseStrategy  
Whitepaper & User Overview  

---

## Summary

PulseStrategy is a decentralized, community-driven protocol built on PulseChain, designed to grow value for holders in a transparent, trustless way. 

Inspired by MicroStrategy’s leveraged Bitcoin accumulation to create value for shareholders, PulseStrategy uses immutable smart contracts to create self-sustaining, community owned decentralized reserves with deflationary mechanics that benefit everyone involved. 

Whether you’re a long-term holder looking for steady growth, a trader seeking profits, or a liquidity provider looking to earn rewards, PulseStrategy offers a unique opportunity for you.    

This whitepaper explains how PulseStrategy works, why it’s valuable, and how you can get involved. From its deflationary mechanics to its reward system, we’ll break it all down in simple terms while providing the technical details for those who want to dive deeper.

## Core Components

PulseStrategy is made up of three interconnected tokens, each backed by a reserve of PulseChain assets. Let’s break them down:


# xBond: The PLSX Reserve

  xBond is a PRC20 token that represents your share of the PLSX (PulseX’s native token) held in a decentralized smart contract. It’s like a ticket that proves you own a piece of the PLSX vault.  

- **How to Get xBond?**  
  For the first 180 days after the contract is deployed, anyone can mint xBond by depositing PLSX. You get 1 xBond for every 1 PLSX you deposit, minus a small 0.5% fee.  
  **Example:** Deposit 1,000 PLSX → receive 995 xBond (after the 0.5% fee).  

 After 180 days, minting stops forever. The only way to get xBond is to buy it on a decentralized exchange (DEX) like PulseX.  


- **Redemption Guarantee:**  
  At any time, you can redeem your xBond for a share of the PLSX in the contract’s reserve. The reserve is always at least 1:1 with the xBond supply, meaning you’ll never get less PLSX than you put in (minus the initial 0.5% fee). As other users trade xBond and tokens burn, your share of the reserve grows, so each xBond becomes worth *more* PLSX.


- **Transfer Tax:**  
  Every time xBond is transferred (except minting/redemptions), 0.5% of the amount is taxed:  
  - 0.25% is burned (gone forever).  
  - 0.25% goes to the Origin Address.  
  This makes xBond scarcer with every trade, increasing its value for holders.  


- **Why Hold xBond?**  
 The more people trade, the more xBond is burned, the more PLSX each remaining xBond is worth. Plus, xBond holders can claim PLStr rewards (explained below).



# iBond: The INC Reserve
  
  iBond is similar to xBond but backed by INC, another key PulseChain asset. It’s your claim on a portion of the INC reserve held by the iBond smart contract.  


- **How to Get iBond?**  
  Like xBond, you can mint iBond during the 180-day issuance period by depositing INC at a 1:1 ratio (minus a 0.5% fee). After 180 days, minting ends, and iBond can only be bought on a DEX.  
  **Example:** Deposit 1,000 INC → receive 995 iBond.  


- **Redemption Guarantee:**  
  You can redeem iBond at any time for your share of the INC reserve, with a minimum 1:1 backing. As iBond is burned through transfers, each remaining iBond becomes worth more INC.  

- **Transfer Tax:**  
  Just like xBond, iBond transfers (outside minting/redemptions) incur a 0.5% tax: 0.25% burned, 0.25% to the Origin Address.  

- **Why Hold iBond?**  
  iBond holders benefit from traders growing each holders redeemable INC value and can also claim PLStr rewards.



# PLStr: The vPLS Reward System

  PLStr is a PRC20 token backed by vPLS (a staked version of PulseChain’s native token PLS). It’s designed to reward users who hold xBond, iBond, or provide liquidity to their DEX pools. Think of PLStr as a bonus for supporting PulseStrategy’s growth. 


- **How to Get PLStr?**  
  
 **Claim Rewards:** 
If you hold xBond, iBond, or their liquidity pool (LP) tokens (e.g., xBond/PLSX or iBond/INC pairs on PulseX), you can claim PLStr. Rewards are weighted based on your holdings, and LP providers get a **2x boost** to encourage liquidity.  

- **Dynamic Weighting:**  
  The amount of PLStr you can claim depends on a formula that adjusts based on the ratio of PLSX to INC supply. This keeps rewards fair and balanced. INC gets more Plstr because its supply is much smaller than plsx. but holding same value of inc and plsx should get similar amount of PLStr. 

PLStr Weighted Reward Factors

| Holding Asset      | Weight for PLStr Claims   |
|--------------------|--------------------------|
| xBond              | 1x                       |
| iBond              | Dynamic (INC:PLSX ratio) |
| xBond/PLSX LP      | 2x                       |
| iBond/INC LP       | 2x * Dynamic             |



- **Transfer Burn:**  
  Every PLStr transfer (except for claims or redemptions) burns 0.5% of the amount, increasing holders redemption value.  


- **Reward Expiration:**  
  PLStr rewards expire 90 days after the last vPLS deposit. This encourages active participation and ensures the system stays dynamic. Expired rewards are effectively burned, increasing the vPLS backing for remaining PLStr holders.  


- **Redemption:**  
  You can redeem PLStr at any time for a share of the vPLS in the contract’s reserve.

## How PulseStrategy Creates Value


**Deflationary Mechanics**

- **Burns Shrink Supply:** 
Every time xBond, iBond, or PLStr is transferred, a portion is burned (0.25% for xBond/iBond, 0.5% for PLStr). This reduces the total supply, increasing each remaining tokens redeemable value.  

- **Growing Reserves:** 
The PLSX, INC, and vPLS in the contracts can grow slowly over time while the ibond/xbond supplys are deflationary meaning each remaining token represents a larger share of the reserve.  

- **Passive Growth:** 
You don’t need to do anything to benefit. As others trade, your holdings automatically become worth more.

- **Limited Minting Window:**
 After 180 days, no new xBond or iBond can ever be minted. The only way to get them is to buy on a DEX, driving demand for a shrinking supply.  

- **Deflationary Flywheel:** 
As burns reduce supply and demand grows, each bond becomes scarcer and more valuable. This creates a self-reinforcing cycle that rewards long-term holders.

As supply drops (burns), the contract PLSX/INC pool is split among fewer bonds, so each bond's backing increases.

Burn, Supply, and Backing

| Event                | Total Supply | Reserve (PLSX/INC) | Backing per Bond | Description                          |
|----------------------|-------------|--------------------|------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Initial Mint         | 100,000     | 100,000            | 1.00             | Every bond backed 1:1                |
| After Burns (5%)     | 95,000      | 100,000            | 1.05             | Supply shrunk, backing rises         |
| After More Burns     | 90,000      | 100,000            | 1.11             | Backing per bond keeps increasing    |
| After Redemptions    | 80,000      | 90,000             | 1.125            | Even after reserve drops, ratio up   |



**Origin Address (OA) Role**

- **What is the OA?** 
The Origin Address is the account that deploys the contracts. It receives 0.25% of every xBond/iBond transfer.  

- **No Expectations:** 
PulseStrategy doesn’t rely on the OA to do anything. It has no admin powers or control over the contracts.  

- **Potential Benefits:** 
If the OA chooses to act in the ecosystem’s interest, it could use its accumulated tokens to:  
  - Buy more PLSX, INC, or vPLS and deposit them into the contracts, growing the reserves.  
  - Fund marketing or community initiatives to boost adoption.  
  - Provide liquidity to DEX pools.  
  Even if the OA does nothing, the burn mechanics alone ensure value growth for holders.


OA Fee Flow (on Issuance & Transfer)

| Event             | OA gets (PLSX/INC) | OA gets (xBond/iBond) | OA gets (PLStr) | User gets | Burned |
|-------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|-----------------|-----------|--------|
| Issuance          | 0.25% of deposit   | 0.25% of minted bonds | None            | 99.5%     | None   |
| Transfer          | None               | 0.25% of transferred  | None            | 99.5%     | 0.25%  |
| vPLS deposit      | None               | None                  | None            | None      | None   |
| PLStr transfer    | None               | None                  | None            | 99.5%     | 0.5%   |






**Arbitrage Opportunities**

- **Two Prices, One Asset:** 
xBond and iBond have two active ratios:  
  - **DEX Price:** the traded ratio on a DEX like PulseX (market-driven).  
  - **Redemption Value:**  the redeemable ratio of PLSX/INC in reserve (asset-backed).  

- **Profit from Price Gaps:**
 If xBond trades below its redemption value on a DEX, buy cheap, redeem it for PLSX, and profit. If it trades above, they can sell to the DEX and profit.  

- **Win-Win:** 
Every arbitrage trade involves transfers, which burn tokens and increase the value of remaining bonds. Traders profit, and holders benefit. 

```
        DEX Market
        +--------+        xBond/iBond          +-------------------+
        |        +<-------------------------->+                   |
        |  DEX   |                            | PulseStrategy     |
        |        +--------------------------->|   Contract        |
        +--------+     PLSX/INC Redemption    +-------------------+
  (Buy low, redeem, or sell high, repeat)
```



**Liquidity Providers benefits** 

- **2x PLStr for LPs:**
Liquidity Providers earn 2x the PLStr rewards on top of dex fees for supporting the protocol.

- **impermanent loss for LPs:**
 incentive to arbitrage could keep DEX prices in tight ranges since its value is tied to its redemption value, and liquidity providers could face lower impermanent loss.

- **Arbitrage creates fees for LPs:**
 incentive to arbitrage could increase trading volume allowing lps to yield more dex fees.

## Smart Contract Breakdown


**Security & Trustlessness**

- **OpenZeppelin Foundation:**
 All contracts use OpenZeppelin’s battle-tested libraries for ERC20 tokens, safe transfers, and reentrancy protection. 
 
- **Immutable & Permissionless:**
 No admin keys, no upgradability, no pausing. Once deployed, the contracts run exactly as coded, with no human interference possible.
  
- **Non-Custodial:** 
You always control your assets. The contracts only hold reserves to back the tokens you mint or claim. 
 
- **Transparent:** All contract code is verified on-chain, and anyone can inspect it. Metrics like reserve balances, total supply, and burns are publicly queryable.  




## Contract Logic Explained

**xBond & iBond Contracts**

- **Minting (180 Days):**  
  - Deposit PLSX/INC to mint xBond/iBond at a 1:1 ratio (minus 0.5% fee).  
  - After 180 days, minting stops forever. 
 
- **Transfers:**  
  - 0.5% tax on every transfer (except to/from contract or OA):  
    - 0.25% burned, reducing supply.  
    - 0.25% sent to the Origin Address.  
  - Burns make each remaining bond worth more PLSX/INC.  

- **Redemption:**  
  - Redeem xBond/iBond at any time for your share of the PLSX/INC reserve.  

- **Metrics:**  
  - View total supply, reserve balance, total burned, and backing ratio (PLSX/INC per bond) at any time.  



**PLStr Contract**

- **vPLS Deposits:**  
  - Anyone can deposit vPLS to grow the reward pool (minimum 100,000 vPLS).  
  - No PLStr is minted for depositors—it’s purely altruistic, fueling rewards for xBond/iBond/LP holders. 
 
- **Reward Claims:**  
  - Holders of xBond, iBond, or LP tokens can claim PLStr.  
  - Rewards are weighted by a formula that adjusts based on PLSX/INC ratios.  
  - LP providers get 2x rewards to incentivize liquidity.  

- **Reward Expiry:**  
  - Unclaimed rewards expire after 90 days, resetting the reward pool.  
  - Expired rewards effectively burn PLStr, increasing vPLS backing for claimed PLStr.  

- **Transfers:**  
  - 0.5% of PLStr transfers are burned (except for claims/redemptions).  

- **Redemption:**  
  - Redeem PLStr for a share of the vPLS reserve at any time.

# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

**Q: What happens if the Origin Address does nothing?**  
A: The protocol doesn’t rely on the OA. Burns from transfers alone ensure that each xBond/iBond is backed by more PLSX/INC over time.  

**Q: Why would anyone trade xBond or iBond?**  
A: Traders profit by arbitraging price differences between DEXs and the contract’s redemption value. Every trade burns tokens, making bonds scarcer and more valuable for holders.  

**Q: Can the contracts be upgraded or paused?**  
A: No. They’re fully immutable, with no admin keys or backdoors. The code runs as written, forever.  

**Q: What happens after the 180-day minting window?**  
A: No new xBond/iBond can be minted. Supply can only shrink through burns, and demand must come from DEXs, driving scarcity and value.  

**Q: Who can deposit vPLS for PLStr rewards?**  
A: Anyone, including the OA or community members. Depositing vPLS doesn’t mint PLStr for the depositor—it grows the claimable PLStr pool for xBond/iBond/LP holders that are supporting the ecosystem.
