PulseStrategy is a decentralized, community-driven protocol built on PulseChain, designed to grow value for holders in a transparent, trustless way. 

Inspired by MicroStrategy’s leveraged Bitcoin accumulation to create value for shareholders, PulseStrategy uses immutable smart contracts to create self-sustaining, community owned decentralized reserves with deflationary mechanics that benefit everyone involved. 

Whether you’re a long-term holder looking for steady growth, a trader seeking profits, or a liquidity provider looking to earn rewards, PulseStrategy offers a unique opportunity for growth.

Contract Logic Explained

#### xBond & iBond Contracts

- **Minting (180 Days):**  
  - Deposit PLSX/INC to mint xBond/iBond at a 1:1 ratio (minus 0.5% fee).  
  - After 180 days, minting stops forever. 
 
- **Transfers:**  
  - 0.5% tax on every transfer (except to/from contract or OA):  
    - 0.25% burned, reducing supply.  
    - 0.25% sent to the Origin Address.  
  - Burns make each remaining bond worth more PLSX/INC.  

- **Redemption:**  
  - Redeem xBond/iBond at any time for your share of the PLSX/INC reserve.  


#### PLStr Contract

- **vPLS Deposits:**  
  - Anyone can deposit vPLS to grow the reward pool (minimum 100,000 vPLS).  
  - No PLStr is minted for depositors—it’s purely altruistic, fueling rewards for xBond/iBond/LP holders. 
 
- **Reward Claims:**  
  - Holders of xBond, iBond, or LP tokens can claim PLStr.  
  - Rewards are weighted by a formula that adjusts based on PLSX/INC ratios.  
  - LP providers get 2x rewards to incentivize liquidity.  

- **Reward Expiry:**  
  - Unclaimed rewards expire after 90 days, resetting the reward pool.  
  - Expired rewards effectively burn PLStr, increasing vPLS backing for claimed PLStr.  

- **Transfers:**  
  - 0.5% of PLStr transfers are burned (except for claims/redemptions).  

- **Redemption:**  
  - Redeem PLStr for a share of the vPLS reserve at any time.
